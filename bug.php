This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined variables.  The variable `$result` is used before it's been assigned a value. This leads to a Notice in PHP, but more severely it could result in unexpected behavior or even errors if you were to attempt to use that variable later.  The variable might contain garbage data or nothing at all depending on the PHP environment.
